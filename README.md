# lawlib-wordpress-theme
templates and code for custom content-types and other law library functionality

Includes template files and functions.php for the website I developed and deployed for the Case Western Reserve Law School's library in
in 2010 (with subsequent support and content-shepherding over the years). This site replaced an awkward combination of a Moveable Type
blog and an excessively inflexible sub-portion of the law school's overall website in order to provide the library with a flexible, internally-
managed CMS to provide blog, research-guide, scheduling information, and other dynamic content. The site also included a finding tool
for networked electronic content ("library databases") provided to the library's users. This tool was initially developed by Jeremiah 
Bryant and myself as a stand-alone PHP site but I subsequently added the functionality within the Wordpress site to take advantage
of the same authorial/editorial back-end for library staff.

With the exception of two inappropriately table-based display elements that I (reluctantly) used to match broader law-school or university sites in
place at the time, this site strove for compliance with Web standards, for semantic mark-up, and for full embrace of CSS3 for all
presentation and layout. The main typeface is a custom font derived by the CWRU Law Review from the LaTex Latin Modern font. It is 
called Legal Modern. I converted it to a webfont via Font Squirrel and other utilities. It is not perfectly hinted for online use, and
does scale incorrectly at some sizes but is effective as used on the site. Among the attributes of the font is a *true* smallcaps character
set. This is important for use in many legal citations, and allows the website to follow the BlueBook citation conventions for formal
publications.
